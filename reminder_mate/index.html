        Reminder Mate is a simple productivity app to help users manage reminders.
        It allows users to add reminders at specific time and get reminded through notifications.
        It provides an easy way to snooze reminders or mark completed through notifications itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reminder Mate is completely offline and does not share any user data.
        <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/2819582?hl=en">Android backup</a> backs
        up Reminder Mate data as well. You can also do a manual backup and restore through settings page in the app.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reminder Mate is ideal for use cases like
    <ul>
        <li>Birthdays and Anniversaries</li>
        <li>Daily chores (boil milk, start washing machine)</li>
        <li>Weekly chores (Visit grocery store, plan weekend activity, take laptop backup)</li>
        <li>Monthly chores (Pay rent, newspaper bill)</li>
        <li>One off (visit dentist, cancel premium trial subscription)</li>
        <li>Other recurring periods (car service)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Reminder Mate is totally free and without any ads. It uses the latest Material 3 UI design.
        It is built with the philosophy of producing high quality apps that are simple and easy to use.

    <h2><a id="faq">FAQ</a></h2>
    <p>
        1. As Reminder Mate is offline, do I need to take regular backup of data? <br />
        Ans. Android settings has <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/2819582?hl=en">device backup</a>
        feature.
        This regularly backs up apps on the device (usually on a daily basis) and backs up Reminder Mate data as well.
        This
        should be sufficient for most usecases. You can also do a manual backup of Reminder Mate data through settings
        page of the
        app and use it to restore reminders later.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. How does purging old reminders from settings page work?<br />
        Ans. Reminder mate would delete periodically reminders that are in completed state for more than 30 days.
        This would ensure that number of reminders does not increase to slow down the app. Any reminder with start date
        of more than 30 days would have their start dates changes so that they are within 30 days.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Backup Format</h2>

    </p>
    We believe that data outlives code. It should be easier for users to take their data from one app and export it
    to another app in case they want to do that. So we publish our data format so that it enables the user to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data is saved in gzipped JSON format when you do a backup from settings page. File has the following format
        remindermate_&lt;yyyyMMddHHmm&gt;.json.gz. Eg. remindermate_202307122102.json.gz.
    </p>
    <p>
        Content has an array of reminders and actions similar to the following.</p>

        <p>One-off reminder</p>
        <pre><code>
