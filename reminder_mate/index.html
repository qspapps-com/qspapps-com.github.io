    <h2><a id="faq">FAQ</a></h2>
    <p>
        1. As Reminder Mate is offline, do I need to take regular backup of data? <br />
        Ans. Android settings has <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/2819582?hl=en">device backup</a>
        feature.
        This regularly backs up apps on the device (usually on a daily basis) and backs up Reminder Mate data as well.
        This
        should be sufficient for most usecases. You can also do a manual backup of Reminder Mate data through settings
        page of the
        app and use it to restore reminders later.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. How does purging old reminders from settings page work?<br />
        Ans. Settings page has an option to purge old reminders by clicking on the corresponding entry. This would
        delete
        all reminders that are older than 30 days and are in completed status. If it is a repeating reminder, then start
        date
        of the reminder would be updated and all the reminders that are older than that would be deleted. If the
        repeating
        reminder has an end time and that is older than 30 days, then that reminder is completely removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. How does periodic purge from settings page work?</br>
        Ans. Periodic purge runs a background job once a day and removes all completed reminders that are more than 30
        days old.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Backup Format</h2>

    </p>
    We believe that data outlives code. It should be easier for users to take their data from one app and export it
    to another app in case they want to do that. So we publish our data format so that it enables the user to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data is saved in gzipped JSON format when you do a backup from settings page. File has the following format
        reminder_mate_&lt;yyyyMMdd&gt;_&lt;HHmmss&gt;.json.gz. Eg. reminder_mate_20230712_210259.json.gz.
    </p>
    <p>
        Content is an array of json objects similar to the following.</p>

        <p>One-off reminder</p>
        <pre><code>
            {
                "title": "Take laptop backup",
                "description": "",
                "recurrences": [
                    {
                        "startTime": "3 Jul 2023 05:13 PM",
                        "repeatInterval": 0,
                        "intervalUnit": "none"
                    }
                ],
                "reminders": [
                    {
                        "firstWhen": "3 Jul 2023 05:13 PM",
                        "when": "3 Jul 2023 05:13 PM",
                        "status": "completed"
                    }
                ]
            }</code>
        </pre>
    <p>Recurrences have a <code>startTime</code> and an optional <code>endTime</code>. For one-off reminders, <code>repeatInterval</code> 
    is 0 and <code>intervalUnit</code> is none. 
</p>
    <p>Repeat reminders look like the below</p>
    <pre><code>
        {
            "title": "Pick up milk",
            "description": "",
            "recurrences": [
                {
                    "startTime": "4 Jul 2023 01:00 PM",
                    "repeatInterval": 1,
                    "intervalUnit": "day"
                }
            ],
            "reminders": [
                {
                    "firstWhen": "4 Jul 2023 01:00 PM",
                    "when": "4 Jul 2023 01:00 PM",
                    "status": "completed"
                },    
            ]
        }
    </code>
    </pre>
    <code>intervalUnit</code> could be hour, minute, day, week, month or year. reminders has entry only for completed reminders or if you have snoozed
    a reminder. <code>firstWhen</code> differs from <code>when</code> for snoozed reminders. <code>status</code> is todo, completed or deleted.
