   <h1>QSP Apps</h1>
   <p>Building high <b>Quality Simple Productivity(QSP)</b> apps for mobile and desktops.</p>

   <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>

   <p>Product should be simple, easy to use and reliable.</p>

   <ol>
      <li>Your product should help improve the quality of life for the user. Make the world a better place.</li>
      <li>Simplicity. App should be simple to use. Code used for building app should be simple.</li>
      <li>Iterate. Build a minimal MVP and then iterate each time adding more and more features.</li>
      <li>Listen to user feedback. This could be comments in the App store. Use it to improve the product.</li>
      <li>Respect privacy. User owns their data. If possible, make the app for offline use and provide ways to
         backup easily using the choice of cloud storage.</li>
      <li>Data outlives code. Publish your data storage format so that it is easy for users to move to a
         different app. Users should have a way out if your app is no longer supported or user has found
         better alternatives.</li>
      <li>Use as less code as possible. Lesser code means easier maintenance. However, this should not
         compromise on functionality. Using less code also requires expertise.</li>
      <li>Use the right SDK/language/tool for the purpose. Every SDK/language/tool has its own
         strengths and ways of building. Understand and exploit them fully.</li>
      <li>Automate as much as possible. Initially this takes time but gives great rewards in the long run.
         This includes building CI pipeline and having sufficient tests.</li>
      <li>Add good number of tests to test the functionality of the app. This ensures that we don&apos;t
         break anything and gives confidence in our product.</li>
      <li>Refactor. As you add features, keep refactoring code so that code remains simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Get your code reviewed. Others might provide insights to improve your code that you might
         not be able to see.</li>
      <li>Measure and improve. Make data based informed decisions.</li>
   </ol>
